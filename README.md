# URL_testing
Script created to open Browsers with supplied url. This script was created to test
products such as Bromium.
The script works by supplying it a text list of url's. The script will open 10 browsers wait 45 seconds for anything bad to do its 
work, then closes all the browsers.
It then waits 5 seconds before opening 10 more. It continues this process until all of the url's have been tested.
